# caesar-cipher

My version of the caesar cipher algorithm.
Currently it asks user for direction: `encode` to encrypt, or `decode` to decrypt, but no matter the user input, the encryption will occur.
Then it asks for the text to be encrypted, and for the number that user wants the password shifted by.
Next it encrypts the message by the number provided by the user, and prints it.
