# caesar-cipher

My version of the caesar cipher algorithm.
It asks user for direction: `encode` to encrypt, or `decode` to decrypt.
Then it asks for the text to be encoded/decoded, and for the number that user wants the password shifted by.
Next it encodes/decodes the message by the number provided by the user, and prints it.
